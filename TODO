 - Add arc_ prefix to variable/function/constant names to avoid collisions of common names.
 - Implement Query String object as a Map (Similar to the HTTP Headers Map).
 - Change logger to end with '\n' by default.
 - Another something with logger(Don't remember).
 - Better way to log errors that would allow the user to access the error messages to display on custom 5XX pages.
 - Consider adding a new log function(log_exception) that automatically logs function name and line and also duplicates the error message into a seperate (thread local) buffer so that it can be displayed in a 4XX/5XX page.
 - If Content-Type is x-www-form-urlencoded put in a form map object, like query string.
 - Add remove to token_map.
 - ? Add modes to the map, so it can behave in one way when being an HTTP Headers map(e.g. Keys being case irrelevant) and different ways in other maps.
 - Since map is no longer used just for headers, consider changing implementation to a sorted or hashed map.
 - Use strcasecmp for arc_token_map.
